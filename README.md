Embedded System Design

This repository showcases a fully functional media center using the MCB1700 development board which consists of a Cortex M3/M4 CPU and uVision IDE. The media center includes a photo gallery, an mp3 player, and a game center (a simple Snake game and a complex Flappy Birds), showcasing a variety of embedded programming concepts learned throughout the academic semester (4th Year Electrical Engieering at Toronto Metropolitian/Ryerson University).

Features:

> Photo Gallery: Displays various BMP images on the LCD, navigable using the MCB1700's joystick.
> MP3 Player: Streams audio from a PC (Source: Youtube) to the development board via USB, with volume control using the on-board potentiometer.
> Game Center: Includes interactive games (Snake and Flappy Birds) that utilize the MCB1700's LCD and joystick.

Project Specifications

> Graphical Interface: A menu-driven interface on the LCD for navigating between the photo gallery, mp3 player, and games.
> User Interaction: Uses the joystick for navigation and selection, with optional LED indicators and keyboard input for game controls.
> BMP Image Handling: Converts BMP files to C arrays for display on the LCD using GIMP for image processing.
> USB Audio Streaming: Implements USB communication for streaming audio from a PC, with interrupt handling and volume adjustment.
